# Expression Builder

Author: Zihan Alex Xu

This one-page React application serves as a visual tool for creating an "expression". It takes in a list of JavaScript functions and renders input fields based on the number of arguments of the functions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
